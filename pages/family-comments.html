                For me as a Mum, when I first stepped into Playgroup there was an instant warmth in all you do. I could
                not be happier that our girl came to Playgroup to start her learning journey, and it has definitely set
                her up for her next steps.

                Thank you soooooo much for making our son’s time at Playgroup most enjoyable. He has loved every minute!
                It is sad his time has come to an end, but I’m positive he’ll take away very fond memories. I’m so glad
                he had the opportunity to be at East Craigs Playgroup!

                We have loved watching our daughter grow at Playgroup. There
                was nothing nicer than watching her become so excited and

                her early years in the most perfect, safe, happy place.

                A massive thank you for all you have done for both my boys! Our
                son loved Playgroup and will miss it so much! He loved the arts
                and crafts in particular and always came home proudly showing
                off his new creations. You are all amazing! Both my boys are so
                fond of you all and the confidence you have all given them both
                over the years and the skills to cope with nursery and school and
                beyond are invaluable and I can’t thank you enough.

                I have always thought you have all been great at making sure
                parents are ok too, from when our son was settling to just
                recently when he was having a “moment” you are all so

                We were very happy to meet your East Craigs Playgroup team.
                You are all very kind and nice. You have helped us through the
                most difficult time when settling our daughter and made her have
                a very happy time at Playgroup.

                We can’t thank you enough for looking after our wee boy. It has
                been his first experience of being within a child care setting with a
                number of other kids and it has been a wonderful foundation.
                It has been truly wonderful to see him skip into Playgroup in the
                morning and that is down to the amazing team getting him to
                settle. He has loved the curriculum which has included going to
                Christmas parties, meeting animals up close and sports days. It
                brings us great joy to see his art work that we get home.

                We can’t thank you enough for all the care and support you have
                given our son over the last few years. He has absolutely loved
                his time at Playgroup and has grown so much during his time with
                you, both physically and socially. When he first came to you, he
                had never been away from family and had such limited
                experience of playing with other children. You made him feel so
                welcome and he loved it from the get go – this is testament to the
                loving, caring and nurturing ladies you are. We recommend
                Playgroup to anyone who will listen.

                Thank you for all you have done for our daughter and our family.
                She has become more confident, imaginative and sociable in her
                play and we know we have Playgroup to thank for this. It was our
                daughter’s first “big step” towards independence from myself and
                her dad and the support you provided was greatly appreciated.
                We appreciate all the hard work and effort that is put into
                Playgroup and we would have been lost without it this past year
                and a half. We look back on our time at Playgroup with the
                fondest of memories!
