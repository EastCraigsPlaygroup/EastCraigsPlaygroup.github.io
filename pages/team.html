                        I qualified as a Primary School Teacher in 1998 and worked as a Nursery Teacher for 10 years but took a break when I had my eldest daughter in 2008. This break continued for nine years as my family grew, and I rejoined East Craigs Playgroup as manager in 2018. The playgroup team were most welcoming and I couldn't imagine working with a better bunch!</div>

                        I initially began at playgroup for my work experience and enjoyed working with children so much that I volunteered there once I left school. So when a position became available as a fulltime member of staff I jumped at the chance. I am thoroughly enjoying each day!

                        I first became involved with the playgroup when my children went in 2003/ 2005. They loved it and I appreciated the safe happy environment that was my children’s first experiences away from home. I started volunteering with playgroup in 2010 and eventually became a paid member of staff.
                        No two days are the same at playgroup but it is an absolute joy helping the children learn through play.
